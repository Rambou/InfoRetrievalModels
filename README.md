# InfoRetrievalModels

This recovery system was implemented on Java version 8 and involves creating and evaluating different variants of a simple lemurcgi information retrieval system. The system can receive queries, compares them with a set of texts, and returns results to a relativity rank. The access and crawling of the page is done with the [jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) library.
